The ATM Card Issuance and Usage Process begins when a customer requests an ATM card from the bank, either online or in-person. The first task involves verifying the customer’s identity and eligibility for an ATM card by checking their account status and ensuring they meet the bank’s requirements. This verification is dependent on the customer providing accurate information, and it must be completed before moving forward. Once verified, the bank processes the request and generates the ATM card, which is then securely printed and activated. The card production is dependent on the successful verification of the customer's details. While the card is being produced, the bank also generates a Personal Identification Number (PIN) for the customer, which can be sent via mail or provided through a secure online channel. This task can run concurrently with card production but must be securely handled to avoid any breaches. After the card and PIN are prepared, they are dispatched to the customer’s address or handed over at the bank branch. Once the customer receives the card, they are required to activate it through an ATM or online banking portal, which serves as a final step in ensuring the card’s functionality. The card activation process is dependent on the successful receipt of the card by the customer. After activation, the customer can use the ATM card for various transactions, such as cash withdrawals, deposits, or checking balances. Any attempted transaction requires the card to be inserted into an ATM and the correct PIN to be entered. The transaction process is dependent on the successful authentication of the card and PIN. While the customer performs transactions, the ATM system verifies the authenticity of each request by checking the card details against the bank’s database. Throughout the process, tasks such as card generation and PIN creation can occur simultaneously, but each task has dependencies that prevent the process from advancing until the necessary requirements are met, ensuring the security and integrity of the entire system.
