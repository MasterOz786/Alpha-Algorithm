The E-Commerce Order Fulfillment process begins when a customer places an order on the platform, selecting products, entering shipping details, and making the payment. Once the order is placed, the payment is processed through a third-party gateway. If the payment is successful, the process proceeds to the next step; otherwise, the customer is notified of the payment failure. Concurrently, the system checks the availability of the ordered items in the inventory. After confirming the availability of the products, the customer is notified about the order status, including payment confirmation and estimated delivery time. Meanwhile, the packaging process begins, where the ordered items are prepared for shipment and labeled accordingly. Once the order is packed, it is handed over to the delivery service for shipping to the customerâ€™s address. After the order is delivered, the customer receives a confirmation notification. Finally, the customer is encouraged to leave feedback or a review about their experience with the products and the delivery service. Throughout the process, tasks such as inventory checks and customer notifications can run concurrently, but each step is dependent on the successful completion of the previous one to ensure the order is processed, packaged, shipped, and delivered without issues.
