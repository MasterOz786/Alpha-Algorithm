The process of Online Course Enrollment and Management begins with students discovering available courses through a digital catalog. Students can search and filter courses by various criteria such as category, instructor, difficulty level, and course duration. Once a student identifies a course of interest, they proceed to the registration phase. This involves either creating a new account or logging into an existing one. The system then prompts the student to submit personal details and select a payment method, after which the payment processing system validates the transaction. The course registration task is dependent on the successful completion of the payment process; if payment fails, the student is notified, and enrollment is not confirmed. These tasks—course discovery, registration, and payment—are performed in sequence, ensuring that each step’s requirements are met before progressing. However, certain tasks such as course discovery and account creation can occur concurrently, as they do not rely on each other. Once payment is successfully processed, the system confirms the student's enrollment and grants access to the course materials.

After enrollment, students gain access to the course content, which includes lecture videos, readings, assignments, and discussion forums. The delivery of course content is ongoing and can be updated in real-time by the instructor or through automated systems. Students can access content at their own pace, though certain activities or milestones may have deadlines. The system tracks the student’s progress, recording completed tasks, quiz scores, and assignment submissions. Progress tracking is critical as it ensures that students are meeting course expectations and allows instructors to provide timely feedback. The progress tracking system operates concurrently with content delivery, as the content remains available for consumption while progress is monitored and assessed. However, students’ progress updates depend on their engagement with the content, and the system does not record progress unless the student actively completes tasks.

As students near the completion of a course, they are often required to complete a final project or exam, which is automatically or manually graded by the system or instructor. Upon successful completion of all course requirements, the student is awarded a certificate. The certificate issuance is dependent on the student’s progress and final assessment; if the student does not meet the criteria, the certificate is withheld, and the system notifies the student of the necessary steps to resolve any issues. This final certification task is the culmination of a sequence of dependent tasks, starting with course registration and ending with content completion and assessment. Throughout the process, each task depends on the previous step, but certain components such as course content delivery and progress tracking can occur concurrently, allowing students to learn at their own pace while the system continuously monitors their performance. This seamless interaction of tasks ensures that the entire enrollment and management system functions smoothly, providing an efficient and flexible experience for both students and administrators.
